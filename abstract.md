# Abstract
From 1800 to the modern day, the global human population has exponentially increased from 1 billion in 1800 to 7.9 billion. As more human beings inhabit the Earth, civilizational needs for land, food, water, and other resources increase as well. Consequently, forests are cut down and water reservoirs are depleted, causing great harm to animal populations and biodiversity in the wild. Biodiversity is important to humankind for many reasons, including food, resources for pharmaceuticals, cultural significance, etc. As such, wildlife conservation is an important issue in the modern age. Scientists have contributed many studies in an ongoing effort to identify tangible actions that help and hurt wildlife. However, there are many such studies and actions, and a shortage of human labor to disperse this knowledge to the public. As such, Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods that automatically derive understanding from text, such as summarization or classification, can be helpful to aid in this effort. In this paper, we describe two ways NLP can help with wildlife conservation efforts, and train a large language model to classify actions as helpful, hurtful, or neutral in wildlife conservation.
