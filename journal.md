Hello! This is my first entry. How exciting!

In this journal, I will be recording my progress, discoveries, roadblocks, thoughts and feelings, etc. surrounding the research I am conducting towards the final project for this class. I look forward to this journey and I hope I am able to produce interesting and helpful work by the end of the semester.
