Hello! This is my first entry. How exciting!

In this journal, I will be recording my progress, discoveries, roadblocks, thoughts and feelings, etc. surrounding the research I am conducting towards the final project for this class. I look forward to this journey and I hope I am able to produce interesting and helpful work by the end of the semester.

**Progress:** Today I looked through the 2021 and 2020 iterations of the NeurIPS Workshop Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning for papers related to NLP and climate, since my background is in NLP. I compiled a list of eight papers for literature review.

**Progress:** Today I read two papers from the aforementioned lit review. One was about creating benchmarking tasks for remote sensing (CV). The other was about classifying corporate disclosures for climate risk. It may be interesting to think of some NLP-related benchmarking tasks, such as taking large pre-trained language models and fine-tuning them on climate risk text classification. The problem with this is that I will need a large amount of labeled data, which I do not have at the moment. I will continue looking for a labeled dataset, but it may also be interesting to think of weak labelling algorithms to automatically label climate-related text data.

**Progress:** Today I read six more papers from the lit review. They were on (1) QA for financial sustainability reports, (2) counting cows, (3) measuring the carbon impact of federated learning, (4) counting oil and gas infrastructure, (5) detecting whether sentences are talking about climate change, and (6) using ML to understand ocean ecosystems. Thus completes my literature review.

I am still somewhat unsure of what my project will be since I don't have access to financial sustainability report data which could be used to train a classification model. Also, that sort of thing is not very interesting to me.

I liked the counting cows paper and the ideas of the ocean paper. I'd like to do something related to animal conservation. Maybe I could scrape papers on animal conservation and try to identify the animal being discussed, and classify the degree of endangerment. Data could be collected from here: https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14691795. I could just scrape the abstracts as input text to the classifier. I guess I'm not sure if there's a need for this, however. I'll try to look into pressing issues related to animals/the ocean that involve text. I'm sure I'll find something :)

**Update:** I read some more papers on ML x wildlife conservation, and I found a site with a lot of relevant text data! https://www.conservationevidence.com/ I emailed them to see if I could have access to the data in spreadsheet format. Hopefully they reply...!
